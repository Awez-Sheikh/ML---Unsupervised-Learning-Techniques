# ML---Unsupervised-Learning-Techniques
1. K-Means Clustering: Created a machine learning model using the Kmeans algorithm to perform clustering, grouping similar data points without labels for pattern discovery and data segmentation.   
2. K-Nearest Neighbour:
a. Created a machine learning model using the Kmeans algorithm on Mall\_Customers dataset to perform clustering, grouping similar data points without labels for pattern discovery and data segmentation.(KNN).
b. Prepare an IRIS dataset for training with machine learning algorithm by applying KNN ML techniques to classify flower species based on their petal and sepal features.(KNN_2).
